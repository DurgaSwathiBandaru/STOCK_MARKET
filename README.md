#  Stock Market Analysis

This project performs **data analysis and prediction** on stock market data using Python.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with **Machine Learning models** like **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** to uncover trends and make predictions.

##  Features
- Load and clean stock market dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize sector-wise distributions and other market patterns  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models (Random Forest & Linear Regression)  
- Generate easy-to-understand visual insights  

##  Dataset
The dataset used is `stock_data.csv`.  
To run the notebook:  
1. Place the CSV in the same folder as `Stock_Market.ipynb`.  
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter** or **Google Colab**.  
3. Run all cells to see the analysis and predictions.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression)  

## ðŸ“ˆ Machine Learning Models
1. **Random Forest** â€“ for classification & regression tasks  
2. **Linear Regression** â€“ for predicting stock price trends  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:  
   ```bash
   cd stock-market-analysis
   ```
3. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Market.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
- Add more advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM for time-series)  
- Automate data fetching from APIs  
- Build a web dashboard for live market visualization
